resend them via Hipchat or email, etc

## Features

- Seats on hipchat listening to users updates
- reminds users to send their updates as the time comes close to the limit
- knows when it has all the updates
- persists the state to support restarts
- switchable backends (rigth now memory and ElasticSearch)
- extensible to other chat systems

These are all WIP
